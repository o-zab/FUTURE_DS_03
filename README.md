# Road Accident Data Analysis  
---

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes road accident data to identify accident trends, high-risk areas, and severity patterns. The goal is to generate actionable safety insights and build a data-driven dashboard for visual storytelling.

---

## Skills Applied
- Data Cleaning & Wrangling (Pandas)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Time Series Analysis
- Geographic and Temporal Pattern Recognition
- Visualization Design (for Power BI Dashboard)

---

## Files Included
- `Road Accident Data.csv`: Source dataset
- `Cleaned_Road_Accident_Data.csv`: Processed dataset for visualization
- `output/`: Folder with saved `.png` charts
- `road_accident_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with complete EDA code
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

---

## Key Insights
- **Accidents are highest** during peak traffic hours (8–9 AM, 4–6 PM)
- **Fridays and Mondays** show the most accidents
- **Urban areas** and certain districts have disproportionately high accident rates
- **"Slight" severity** accounts for the majority of reported incidents

---

## Visuals Generated
- Severity Distribution Bar Chart
- Monthly Trend Line Chart
- Top 10 Districts Bar Chart
- Heatmap of Accidents by Hour and Day of Week

All visuals are saved in the `output/` folder and used in the Power BI dashboard.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI (for dashboard building)
